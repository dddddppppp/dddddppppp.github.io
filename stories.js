					"WE NEED YOUR OPINION. Through a Facebook ad, a boy contacted me, commenting that he was going to leave an apartment with the characteristics that I was looking for (apartment in Utrecht with a maximum budget of 500 euros and 3 rooms) and he sent me an email and the landlords contact details. This boy told me that they had also been living there for a scholarship and that they were leaving the apartment (he seemed very close and friendly). Before contacting the landlord, I asked the boy if he had photos of the apartment and he said that he did not but that his roommate did, that he would give me his phone number so that she could pass the photos on to me. I spoke to her and she gave me photos of all the rooms in the apartment and everything seems correct, without any suspicion. Then I spoke to the landlord, commenting that his former tenants had given me his number and he gave me all the rental information. I told him that I was going to share the information with my future roommates and after a while he told me that other students had spoken to him with the intention of renting the apartment but that he was going to wait for us to confirm it. He also asks us for a month of rent + the deposit, a total of 1000 euros each to be able to reserve it. When commenting to him that if due to the pandemic we could not go to study in Utrecht if he would return the money, he told us that he would return everything except about 20 euros for expenses. We think everything is very good but we don't trust knowing the number of scammers there are. It seems to me that we have spoken with many people about the flat to make it a fraud. What is your opinion?",
					"Me and my girlfriend got accepted into university, myself in Den Haag and my girlfriend in Leiden. When searching for rooms and apartments we spent about 2 months searching and getting in contact with landlords and agencies but with no luck. We eventually found one apartment in Den Haag, for one month we had to pay a deposit of €800 and one months rent of €800. We were really skeptical about this because we were not able to register in the property which meant that we cannot legally work. This was a huge problem as we were already spending a lot of money travelling. But because time was ticking, we panicked and eventually paid the deposit. Without being able to view the property as we were in the UK. We thought it was a scam and we had no idea if we would have anywhere to stay when we got to the Netherlands. We eventually meet with the “landlord” and he mentioned that the apartment was his brothers (suspicious). He gave us a one page contract with very little details to keep the place clean etc. (again suspicious). We handed over the rent money and he gave us two sets off keys. This was such a surreal experience as there was no one that was able to help us find suitable rooms/apartments even as international students. So we were completely left alone to navigate this complex system. Then more stress came along when we had to find another place to stay after this one. Again it was a game of chance and luck. Fortunately we found student housing.",
					"During my search for housing I came across an advertisement that was appealing, cheap room and good location. So I contacted the landlord and she said that I could have a virtual tour of the apartment by registering to Studentenonderdak.nl which is probably a fake website. She then proceeded to email me saying that the VR tour will not work on that website, so she would give the VR tour via Snapchat. I needed a special code for this. According to her, the code I made wasn’t working (even though it had to be random) and I had to give her the code of the ‘for you only’ parrt in the gallery of Snapchat, which I obviously didn’t do. When I checked my Snapchat, I was logged out and I had to make a new password. They only took my email address. I then got an email from a made up Snapchat email address telling me to give my date of birth and the ‘for you only’ code. At last but not least she offers the room in both Gent and Utrecht.",
					"Hi every one. I’m a first-year student and living outside NL right now. I’m finding a room available from Sep and saw this room. The landlord told me like that. So I want to ask whether I would receive the contract via email and thekey when I come. Is this possible? And how do I receive key and contract if I live outside? Do I pay deposit and first month rent when I come in September? Is there anyone was approached with this guy? His name is ------------. I don’t know how to rent a room in NL so pls help me.",
					"Hello everyone, It seems that Netherlands is full of scamming Landlords. I arrived to the Netherlands in august 2019 I moved to a place through a shady company named Amstel Housing. 25-30 meters square place in hoofddorp near by centrum, it’s the 2nd floor in a house I didn’t know about the renting prices in The Netherlands it was for 1200 euros per month without internet and TV when I received the bills with my name I went to lawyer for consultation and he said that I am being scammed by this professional scammers. Fred and his partner is Siebrand de Groot, the scammer registered me as I am renting the whole house to make me pay the bills of the house and there are 2 families living in the same house living black without registration. I went to lawyer name “roos sibbies” in law office name tanger advocaten, she told me that he is running a shady business, then she started to contact him, after that she turned out to be against me and she forced me to sign agreement to reduce rent and not to ask for refund after. I tried to contact her and called her office number and sent her emails but she doesn’t get in touch with me so I have decided not to pay the rent starting from May 2020 as he has 2400 euros deposit and 1800 euros he must refund for the first 6 months but unfortunately the lawyer collaborated with him against me and I am supposed to be her client, now he is provoking me to try to set me up with troubles. The gemeente can’t change the address until the owner, the scammer change it by himself. All people in hoofddorp and all over netherlands be careful to not fall in such a trap that I am currently in.",
					"As an outsider to the Netherlands it was a real struggle to find a place to stay. It seemed like no one wanted to help. Online forums helped but they weren’t regularly updated. Registration is also important to be able to rent and sign housing contracts but it was a loop trying to find a place that would let us register but they were always super expensive or just not what I wanted.",
					"What's the best way to find an accommodation??\nReply:\nUsually it’s best to react on posts of people in groups.\nYou also have some housing companies in The Netherlands but I’m not sure if it’s the best option. It’s normal as a student look for a place in multiple facebook groups.\nI understand it’s really a struggle if you don’t know anyone in a city or in the country but usually a network works really well in finding a place.\nA few tips to reconize scammers;\n- You can distinguish the fake profiles by looking into their friends, posts or their original country.\n- They post very weird links about housing sites. Usually when You yourself post a message about looking for a place.\n- Dutch people tend to have a phone number starting with +31.\nGoodluck!",
					"I first came to the Netherlands with my boyfriend, both of us expat students. We managed to find a temporary flat for a month on kamernet, the guy was renting it out whilst he was in columbia. We were not allowed to register ourselves to that address, which meant we couldn't get a BSN number. You cannot work without a permanent address or a BSN number? From the amount of places we applied, very few actually replied and we only got to view one. You can tell with a scam because the pictures are either too perfect or they have one photo, some houses even have the same photo. I definitely nearly got scammed with one property. At the time I was desperate so I felt even though the images and the price were dodgy I still replied, the guy was talking about his wife and how she really wanted to find some tenants quickly so they can move into their new property and he then sent us a contract which appeared to be just a word document with no legal affiliation at all. In the end we decided it was best to post on FB looking for other student expats with the same issue and we could rent a house together but again nothing felt safe and i didnt know these people either. I felt let down from both of our universities really for lacking to support international students and annoyed at the apps for letting scammers be able to use there site.",
